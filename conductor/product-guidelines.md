# Product Guidelines - My WezTerm & Tmux Environment

## Visual Identity & Aesthetic
- **Vibrant Nord Palette:** Utilize a "Bright Nord" base—cleaner and higher contrast than standard Nord—as the foundation for the terminal background and UI elements.
- **Electric ANSI Text vs. Nord UI:** Use the high-visibility "Electric" palette (Cyan, Neon Pink, etc.) specifically for **text content** and code to make it "pop." Conversely, ensure UI elements (like status bars, tmux panes) blend seamlessly with the "Nord" theme to maintain visual flow and avoid distraction.
- **Structured Transparency:** Maintain a balance of transparency and blur to create a "glassy" depth without sacrificing text legibility.
- **Sleek Minimalist Prompt:** Prioritize a clean, clutter-free shell prompt using Starship. Use smart directory truncation and high-quality icons/emojis to provide essential context without overwhelming the visual field.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Design-First Development:** Prioritize the visual and interactive feel of every feature. The user acts as the Chief Design Officer, brainstorming and confirming the aesthetic, while the AI manages the technical implementation.
- **Immediate Help:** Provide high-utility help resources, specifically using formatted tables for keybinding references to ensure shortcuts are easy to scan and memorize.
- **Clarity Over Complexity:** Information-rich status bars should be designed with a "glanceable" hierarchy—most important info (e.g., git status, time) must be the most visible.

## Collaborative Process
- **Triple-Option Prototyping:** For every design or feature request, the AI must provide three distinct stylistic variations of the same functional goal. This allows the user to compare different "vibes" and execution styles before committing.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Code is treated as a fluid medium to achieve the desired visual outcome; rapid prototyping of UI elements is encouraged.
