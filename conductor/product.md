# Initial Concept
Modular WezTerm and Tmux configuration project.

# Product Guide - My WezTerm & Tmux Environment

## Product Vision
A personalized, collaborative terminal environment powered by WezTerm and Tmux, evolving through a dynamic partnership between the user and the AI agent. This project aims to create a "Northern Lights" inspired workspace that balances visual beauty with professional-grade efficiency, featuring a collaborative design process where every feature begins with three distinct options.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Personal use, specifically tailored for a localized workflow across Windows (WSL) and Linux.

## Core Goals
- **Collaborative Design:** A development process where every major design decision is preceded by three generated alternatives to foster creativity and choice.
- **Atmospheric Aesthetics:** Implement a vibrant "Northern Lights" (Nordic) theme with cool blues, purples, and strategic transparency.
- **Workflow Efficiency:** Maximize productivity through custom keybindings, seamless pane management, and deep Tmux integration.
- **Guided Learning:** Maintain a "learning-friendly" setup with accessible cheat sheets and a structure that is easy to understand and extend.
- **Informativeness:** A data-rich UI that provides critical system and project context at a glance.

## Key Features
- **Gemini-Inspired ANSI Theme:** A custom ANSI color palette mimicking the vibrant, high-contrast aesthetics of the Gemini chat interface.
- **Nordic/Aurora UI:** A polished visual identity using the Nordic color palette with Aurora accents for window decorations and background elements.
- **Sleek Starship Prompt:** A modern, minimalist shell prompt with smart directory truncation and rich Git status indicators (including GitHub-specific context).
- **Integrated Tmux Management:** Sophisticated session and pane management that works in harmony with WezTerm.
- **Dynamic Status Bars:** Information-heavy status lines in both WezTerm and Neovim to show repo status, time, and system info.
- **On-Demand Help:** Custom keybinding helpers and cheat sheets to facilitate the mastery of complex shortcuts.
- **Cross-Platform Readiness:** A modular configuration that remains consistent and functional across different operating systems.
