# Specification: Starship Prompt Alternatives Visual Analysis

## 1. Overview
The goal of this track is to visually analyze prompt alternatives (Oh-My-Posh, Fish-native, and advanced Starship) to determine if a switch fits our "Northern Lights" aesthetic. The process relies on external galleries and collaborative analysis before any implementation occurs.

## 2. Scope
*   **Candidates:** Oh-My-Posh, Fish-native prompts (Tide, Pure, Hydro), and Starship (Presets).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Sourcing:** Find gallery URLs.
    2.  **Collaboration:** Discuss and analyze visual options.
    3.  **Selection:** Pick the winner.
    4.  **Implementation:** Install and configure the winner.

## 3. Action Items
1.  **Sourcing:**
    *   Find and list the URLs for official theme galleries (Oh-My-Posh, Starship) and visual examples for Fish frameworks (Tide/Pure).
2.  **Collaboration & Analysis:**
    *   Present the galleries to the user.
    *   Discuss specific themes that match the "Northern Lights" aesthetic.
    *   Analyze the features of the user's favorite options (e.g., config format, speed).
3.  **Selection:**
    *   User confirms the chosen tool and specific theme/style to implement.
4.  **Implementation:**
    *   Install the selected tool (if different from current).
    *   Apply the chosen configuration/theme.
    *   Update `tech-stack.md` and `personal-tech-stack.md` if changed.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
*   Gallery URLs are provided.
*   A collaborative discussion results in a clear choice.
*   The chosen prompt is installed, configured, and functional.
*   Documentation is updated.
