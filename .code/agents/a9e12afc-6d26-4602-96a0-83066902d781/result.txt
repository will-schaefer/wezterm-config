Perfect. Now I have enough context to draft a comprehensive plan. Let me create a detailed analysis:

## Analysis & Implementation Plan: Edit Prompt via "Starlight" Config

### Key Findings

After analyzing your WezTerm configuration repo, here's what I discovered:

**Current State:**
- Your config uses **status bars** (left/right) and **tab titles** for UI customization
- **No "starlight" exists** in the repository (confirmed via grep)
- The repo contains shell launch configurations for **Fish, Bash, and Zsh** shells
- Prompt customization currently lives in **shell configuration** (outside WezTerm, in `~/.config/fish`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.)

### Critical Ambiguity: What is "Starlight"?

The term **"starlight" is ambiguous** in this context. It could refer to:

1. **Starship** – A cross-shell prompt framework (most likely)
   - Popular prompt customizer with `.config/starship.toml`
   - Could integrate with WezTerm status bars
   
2. **A custom prompt UI component** you want to add to WezTerm
   - New status bar segment
   - Custom tab indicator
   
3. **A Lua module** you plan to create in this config repo
   - New event handler or utility

**You need to clarify:** Which of these did you intend?

### Proposed Plan (Assuming Starship Prompt Integration)

If you meant **Starship prompt configuration**, here's the plan:

#### **Scope**
Add WezTerm integration with Starship shell prompt configuration, allowing you to customize the shell prompt appearance via Starship's `~/.config/starship.toml` file while maintaining WezTerm's status bars.

#### **Files to Create/Modify**

1. **`config/prompt.lua`** (NEW)
   - Centralized Starship configuration management
   - Export Starship config path and validation helpers
   
2. **`~/.config/starship.toml`** (EXTERNAL, not in repo)
   - User's Starship prompt configuration
   - WezTerm would read/reference this via shell environment
   
3. **`config/launch.lua`** (MODIFY)
   - Add Starship initialization in shell args if needed
   - Set `STARSHIP_CONFIG` environment variable

4. **`events/right-status.lua`** (OPTIONAL)
   - Could display Starship status info in WezTerm's status bar (if desired)

#### **Action Items**

1. **Confirm Starship integration model:**
   - Should WezTerm display Starship info in status bar, or just rely on shell prompt?
   - Which shells (Fish/Bash/Zsh) need Starship?

2. **Create prompt configuration module** (`config/prompt.lua`)
   - Detect if Starship is installed
   - Validate Starship config file exists
   - Provide helpers to read Starship config

3. **Update shell launch config** (`config/launch.lua`)
   - Add Starship initialization to shell startup
   - Set environment variables for Starship path

4. **Optional: Enhance status bar** (`events/right-status.lua`)
   - Add Starship-aware segments if desired

5. **Document setup instructions**
   - Explain Starship installation + config location
   - Note shell compatibility

#### **Testing Plan**

1. Install Starship: `cargo install starship`
2. Create `~/.config/starship.toml` with test configuration
3. Launch WezTerm and verify:
   - Shell prompt displays Starship formatting
   - Status bars still render correctly
   - No conflicts between WezTerm UI and Starship prompt
4. Test each shell (Fish, Bash, Zsh) separately

#### **Risks**

- **Shell prompt rendering issues**: Starship output might conflict with WezTerm's custom status bars
- **Installation dependency**: Starship must be installed separately; config won't work without it
- **Multi-shell complexity**: Different shell init files needed (`.fishrc`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`)
- **WSL-specific issues**: Windows WSL may need special Starship path handling

#### **Open Questions**

1. **Is "starlight" actually "Starship"?** (Or something else?)
2. **Do you want WezTerm's status bars to display Starship info, or keep them separate?**
3. **Which shells need Starship:** All (Fish/Bash/Zsh) or just one?
4. **Configuration scope:** Store Starship config in this repo, or rely on user's `~/.config/starship.toml`?
5. **Should WezTerm validate Starship installation** at startup?

---

### Next Steps

**Before I implement:** Please clarify:
- What does "starlight" refer to?
- What exactly should change about your shell prompt appearance?
- Should WezTerm's status bars be involved, or is this purely shell-level customization?

Once you clarify, I can provide a detailed implementation plan with code changes.
